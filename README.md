# Community Community Kit

RAD has provided a Commnity Kit for EchoVR-related assets [here](https://readyatdawn.sharefile.com/share/view/s29f663b300e245d9871aecabc3dae4c7).

This has more stuff.

The goal of this repository is to enable creators in the EchoVR community to elevate their potential with a shared body of base assets to work off of. We want to take EchoVR content creation to the next level.

## Contributing

If you modify these assets for your own project, please consider contributing back to this repository.

* If you aren't sure if you should add something, err on the side of just adding it and letting somebody else correct it. Something is better than nothing.
* Try to follow the existing folder structure.
* Do not add single files larger than 100MB, or you will not be able to push to GitHub.

Most of these assets are RAD IP, so be respectful and responsible when using them in your projects.
Please note, if you read this, youre a nerd
